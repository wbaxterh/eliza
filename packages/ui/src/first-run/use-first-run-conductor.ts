/**
 * In-chat first-run conductor (headless).
 *
 * Onboarding is PART OF THE CHAT. When `firstRunComplete === false` this hook
 * seeds synthetic assistant turns into the SAME live transcript the floating
 * `ChatOverlay` renders (greeting → runtime CHOICE → provider
 * CHOICE → tutorial CHOICE; Cloud-only sign-in stays a single CTA), and
 * routes the user's first-run-scoped picks to the headless finish use case
 * (`first-run-finish.ts`). It owns NO presentation — the existing
 * `InlineWidgetText` + `SensitiveRequestBlock` renderers draw the widgets for
 * free from message fields. It registers an action handler on the first-run
 * channel so the chat's single send funnel short-circuits first-run picks
 * before they hit the server.
 *
 * The composer is UNLOCKED during onboarding (#12178): the user can type
 * freely, and a second channel handler (`setFirstRunTextHandler`) answers that
 * free text with a local user turn + a deterministic assistant reply that
 * varies by flow position. Free text NEVER reaches the server pre-completion —
 * the AppContext funnel enforces that; this hook only renders the local echo.
 *
 * Provisioning runs exactly once and POSTs /api/first-run exactly once (the
 * finish module funnels + idempotency-guards it). The real `firstRunComplete`
 * flip is DEFERRED to the tutorial-or-skip pick, so the tutorial step is
 * reachable after every runtime path.
 *
 * Confused-user guards (spam taps, stale widgets, out-of-order picks):
 * - `busyRef` — one finish/provision flow at a time; extra picks are consumed
 *   as no-ops while one is in flight.
 * - `provisionedRef` latch — after provisioning succeeds only the tutorial
 *   pick is live; leftover runtime/provider/cloud-agent widgets no-op.
 * - Strict id validation per group — garbage under the reserved prefix is
 *   consumed, never acted on and never forwarded to the server.
 * - needs-cloud-login re-offers an UNLOCKED runtime choice and arms a
 *   connect-and-resume continuation (`pendingCloudResumeRef`).
 *
 * Device RAM-tier gating + reversibility (#14390): the runtime and provider
 * CHOICE blocks are built per-seed against the device's RAM-tier assessment
 * (`device-ram-gate.ts`) — a sub-4 GB phone sees "On this device" labeled
 * unavailable and its tap refused with the reason; 4–7 GB phones may choose
 * hybrid cloud inference but not an unconfigured local runtime, and a sub-12
 * GB phone gets on-device models blocked (never silently hidden). Every
 * sub-step CHOICE carries a "← Back" option whose handler unwinds any
 * partially-committed local runtime (persisted mode, local active server,
 * started service) before re-offering a fresh runtime choice, so onboarding
 * is never forward-only and switching local→cloud leaves nothing running.
 *
 * Cloud-only mode (#13377): the runtime chooser (local / remote) is gated by
 * `isRuntimeChooserEnabled()` and OFF by default. With the chooser off,
 * onboarding is a single "sign in to Eliza Cloud" step — the greeting IS the
 * sign-in prompt, an already-usable session (hosted web with a live login, a
 * durable token, a completed mobile OAuth round trip, or a session recovered
 * from the console's cross-subdomain cookie) enters SILENTLY (#15133): zero
 * onboarding turns for a pure agent reuse, the real provisioning narration
 * only when an agent is actually created or cold-boot woken. Provisioning
 * success flips the real gate immediately. The tutorial is never a completion
 * gate in this mode; it stays reachable from its home tile.
